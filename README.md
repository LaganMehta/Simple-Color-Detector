# Simple-Color-Detector
A simple python project which detects color of a particular image which can be shared as an argument through command prompt

</br>To run the program write the following code: 
</br> python main.py -i colorpic.jpg.
</br> Where colorpic.jpg is the image you want to pass. In my case I have taken Tom and Jerry pic.
</br> Double click the color that you want to know.
